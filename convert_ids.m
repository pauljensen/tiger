%   Creates a cell of names (NAMES), linear indices (IDXS), and logical
%   indices (LOGIC) for the values IDS in the cell ALL_NAMES.  IDS can be 
%   any of the forms previously mentioned.
%
%   If three inputs are given, then only a single value is returned.  The
%   type of id returned is determined by type:
%       'name'    -> NAMES

%       'logical' -> LOGIC
%

%       all_names = {'a','b','c','d'};
%       ids = [2 4];
%       [n,i,l] = convert_ids(all_names,ids);
